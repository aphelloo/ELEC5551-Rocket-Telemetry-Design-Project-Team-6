USER INTERFACE PSEUDOCODE

Procedure InitialiseInterface:
    Create mainWindow with responsive layout 
    Define mapSection, graphSection, and meteringSection as major components of the interface
    Set up GUI for webpage

Procedure SetupMap:
    Add MapComponent to mapSection
        Set markers for Payload Module and Base Station
        Ensure map updates position in real-time based on telemetry data

Procedure SetupGraph:
    Integrate GraphComponent into graphSection
        Plot Altitude, Acceleration or Velocity against Time depending on radio button selection
        Style graphs for maximum clarity

Procedure SetupMetering:
    Integrate MeteringWindow into meteringSection
        Display data for Altitude, Acceleration, Velocity
        Include Compass and Distance indicator with real-time updates

Procedure SetupDataRetrieval:
    Define variables for altitude, velocity, and time 

Procedure CalculateCompassDirection:
    Retrieve current direction from compass (compassDirection)
    Update Compass in webpage based on compassDirection

Procedure CalculateMetrics:
    Retrieve current telemetry data including heading
    Update GraphComponent and MeteringWindow with new data
    Call CalculateCompassDirection
    Calculate distance from current location to base station based on GPS Location

Procedure AdjustLayoutForDeviceType:
    If device is mobile:
        Stack mapSection, graphSection, and meteringSection vertically
    Else:
        Arrange sections horizontally

Procedure RenderInterface:
    Load all components with initial location related telemetry data from matrix
    Implement real-time data refresh across all components

Procedure Main:
While Webpage is open:
      InitialiseInterface()
      SetupMap()
      SetupGraph()
      SetupMetering()
      SetupDataRetrieval()
Exit Page
