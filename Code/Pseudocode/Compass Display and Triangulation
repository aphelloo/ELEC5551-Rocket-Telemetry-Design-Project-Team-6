COMPASS DISPLAY AND TRIANGULATION

\\Initialise Compass  
Import compass graphic to webpage 
For 1/20 seconds read compass input  
Update compass graphic on webpage showing direction the base station is pointing towards basestation

\\Direction finding reading 
While triangulation is active – Loop 
For every 0.5 second interval 
Read signal strength from triangulation antenna - 
Update compass graphic – via size of directional marker	 
If signal strength = 0 (+/- 0.5) %looking for null reading 
Directional Marker = MAX 
Else If signal strength > 0.5 
directional maker size = MAX/signal strength 
End if 

\\Triangulation 
While triangulation is active  
Loop while triangulation is active 
If signal strength = 0 (+/- 0.5) 
Save Tiny GPS data of basestation and compass heading 
Print information on webpage map. 
End if  
End loop 

\\3D triangulation 
Initialise altimeter 
read height from altimeter 
print height on webpage % indicating height from basestation
